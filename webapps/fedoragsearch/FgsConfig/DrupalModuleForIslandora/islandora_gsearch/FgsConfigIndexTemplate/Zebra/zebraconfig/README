Instructions on zebra configuration
-----------------------------------

Copy the .../zebraconfig/ directory to the directory 
that you specified in index.properties/fgsindex.indexDir
(which should not be a subdirectory of your web server) :

  cp .../zebraconfig/* <indexDir>
  
Files you must/may configure:

1 db/zebra.cfg:

    The file is used for zebraidx calls, and indirectly
      for zebrasrv start by yazserver.xml.
    You do not need to change this default configuration. 
    See the Zebra documentation for options.
    Specified directories must exist and be write-permitted.

2 db/yazserver.xml:

    The file is used for zebrasrv start.
    The host and port number must be set to the same as 
      in index.properties/fgsindex.indexBase.
    The references to zebra.cfg, filter_fgs_conf.xml,
      sru2.xsl, and to cql2pqf.txt must be valid
      (and by default they are).

3 db/explain.xml

    This file configures the SRU/SRW explain response.
    The important thing is the list of index fields.
    By default it lists fgs and dc indexes.
    You must update this list, if you tailor the 
    demoFoxmlToZebra.xslt file, so that
    your set of index fields change.
    In that case, you must edit the cql2pqf.txt file also.
    Alternatively, you may generate another cql2pqf.txt file,
    you do this (in linux) by running this xslt transformation
    from command line in <INDEXDIR>/db
    > xsltproc explain2cqlpqftxt.xsl explain.xml > cql2pqf.txt

3 db/cql2pqf.txt

    These are zebra's rules for translation 
      from cql to internal pqf query format.
    The file must have a line per index field.

4 db/filter_fgs_conf.xml
5 db/fgs2index.xsl
    
    You should not change these default configuration files
    unless you have a special need and special insight. 
    
    
For Zebra download, see http://www.indexdata./zebra/.

Alternative download as debian package:

  apt-get install idzebra-2.0 libidzebra-2.0-mod-alvis yaz

Zebra documentation is at http://www.indexdata./zebra/doc/zebra.pdf

Start the zebra server from the directory in
  index.properties/fgsindex.indexDir with

  zebrasrv-2.0 -f db/yazserver.xml

In the default configuration the query language is CQL,
  see http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/cql/,
  the alternative is PQF, see the Zebra documentation
  and http://www.indexdata./yaz/doc/tools.tkl#PQF .
